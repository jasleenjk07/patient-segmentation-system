# Patient Segmentation System for Preventive Healthcare Planning

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment patients based on health, lifestyle, and medical history using the NHANES dataset. The goal is to support preventive healthcare strategies by identifying high-risk patient groups and enabling targeted interventions.

## Project Structure
## Objectives
- Identify clusters of patients with similar health risk patterns
- Support early preventive healthcare interventions
- Optimize resource planning using ML-driven segmentation

## Dataset
**NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)**  
Includes demographics, vitals, lab results, lifestyle behaviors, and medical history.

## Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- PCA Dimensionality Reduction
- Clustering (KMeans / GMM / Hierarchical)
- Cluster Interpretation & Insights
- Optional Streamlit Dashboard

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
